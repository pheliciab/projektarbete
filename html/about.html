    <main-content>
        <p class="ingress">
            Passion. That is the foundation upon which Caramel Colours is built. Paintmixing is crucial to any artist,
            and that's where it all began. With an artist, a love for paint and the will to learn.

                <h3> Our founder </h3>
                    <p>
                        Artist and graphic designer Phelicia Berggren started her journey to become a paintmaker
                        in 2019. She started off being an artist at 18 years old and went to University to study Graphic Design
                        a few years later. Her passion in life is creativity, but most of all - colours! Fascinated by the 
                        beautiful paints from big distributors, she started researching handmade paint. 
                        After months of learning and reading, the result of all the experiments are what you 
                        see in our webshop and our courses today. A pan of paint packaged in a candy wrapper, entirely
                        made by us. We're picky like that.

                <h3>Vision and goals</h3>
                <h4> Quality </h4>
                    Without great quality, the experience of our paint wouldn't be what it is.
                    We strive for high quality pigments from sustainable resources and look for vegan-friendly ingredients everywhere we go.
                    The result of us being responsible for the entire production, from binder to finished product, 
                    is a smooth paint with pigments that comes alive inside your brush.

                <h4> Learning </h4>
                    Through a strong connection with artists and creators Caramel Colours keeps up to date with trends,
                    techniques and colour range. We believe in sharing success, which is why we teach creators all over the world how
                    to create paint and how to achieve great results on their own. We want to inspire and be inspired, 
                    because working together is the way of the future.

                <h4> Sustainability </h4> 
                    From binder to finished paint, from the pans to the packaging - all of our work is dedicated to being as
                    sustainable as we possibly can. Our distilled water comes from a local brewery, all our paper is made from Swedish 
                    forests and the pans, as you know, have their own returning program. As for the pigments, we try our best to find
                    vegan or synthetic high-quality subtitutes.
